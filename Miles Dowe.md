# The webpage of Miles Dowe

## Introduction

Hello and welcome!

I was originally using this space to reiterate my working and academic history, but those are already available on [several](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-dowe-26b33067) [sites](https://www.stackoverflow.com/cv/milesdowe) that I keep fairly up-to-date.  You can also [grab a PDF of my resume here](./content/miles_dowe_resume.pdf).

Instead, I hope to use it as a platform for... blogging? Posting drawings? Maybe as a place to host some experimental web development projects. I haven't quite decided.

I originally wrote up my own HTML and CSS for this page, but it is too much of a hassle for something so small. It's a good thing to stand out, but the return on my time investment wasn't worth it. I like the simplicity of a *Markdown* document and I really love the [Typora](https://typora.io/) text editor, so I am using it to generate this HTML.

## Personal interests

I am a software developer, an amateur cartoonist, and an aspiring <em>Vim</em> superuser. I'm usually the quiet one in a team of people, but am very amiable and happy to take time helping others.
