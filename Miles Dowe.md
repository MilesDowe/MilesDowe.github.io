# Miles Dowe

## Introduction

Hello and welcome!

I haven’t figured out what exactly I’ll be using this site for. Professional details are already available on [several](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-dowe-26b33067) [sites](https://www.stackoverflow.com/cv/milesdowe) that I keep mostly up-to-date.

I could use this as a platform for blogging? Posting drawings? I haven't figured it out yet. It’s tricky to be interesting, but I’ll *someday* make content that’s worthwhile.

Also, if the style of this site is familiar, it’s because I’m using the [Typora](https://typora.io/) text editor to generate this HTML. A todo of mine is to make a custom CSS for it.

## Personal interests

I am a software developer, an amateur cartoonist, and an aspiring *Vim* superuser.
